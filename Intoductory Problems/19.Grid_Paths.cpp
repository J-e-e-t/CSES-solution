/*
There are 88418 paths in a 7Ã—7 grid from the upper-left square to the lower-left square. Each path corresponds to a 48-character description consisting of characters D (down), U (up), L (left) and R (right).

For example, the path

corresponds to the description DRURRRRRDDDLUULDDDLDRRURDDLLLLLURULURRUULDLLDDDD.

You are given a description of a path which may also contain characters ? (any direction). Your task is to calculate the number of paths that match the description.

Input

The only input line has a 48-character string of characters ?, D, U, L and R.

Output

Print one integer: the total number of paths.

Example

Input:
??????R??????U??????????????????????????LD????D?

Output:
201

Warning: Run times

Please note: the running times and number of recursive calls listed are for a separate but very similar problem (# paths from upper left to lower right corner on a 7x7 grid). They may not be entirely accurate, but they illustrate the effect of each optimization. The data is also C++ specific, so Java and Python users will experience significantly different runtimes. The consequences of this discrepancy which will be addressed later in the explanation.

Basic Algorithm

The first version of the algorithm does not contain any optimizations. We simply
use backtracking to generate all possible paths from the upper-left corner to
the lower-right corner and count the number of such paths.

Running time: $483$ seconds
Number of recursive calls: $76$ billion

Optimization 1

If the path reaches the lower-right square before it has visited all other
squares of the grid, it is clear that it will not be possible to complete the
solution. Using this observation, we can terminate the search immediately if we
reach the lower-right square too early.

Running time: $119$ seconds
Number of recursive calls: $20$ billion

Optimization 2

If the path touches a wall and can turn either left or right, the grid splits
into two parts that contain unvisited squares. In this case, we cannot visit all
squares anymore, so we can terminate the search.

Running time: $1.8$ seconds
Number of recursive calls: $221$ million

Optimization 3

The idea of Optimization 2 can be generalized: if the path cannot continue
forward but can turn either left or right, the grid splits into two parts that
both contain unvisited squares. It is clear that we cannot visit all squares
anymore, so we can terminate the search.

Running time: $0.6$ seconds
Number of recursive calls: $69$ million


Now is a good moment to stop optimizing the algorithm and see what we have
achieved. The running time of the original algorithm was $483$ seconds, and now
after the optimizations, the running time is only $0.6$ seconds. Thus, the
algorithm became nearly $1000$ times faster after the optimizations.

In backtracking, the search tree is usually large and even simple observations can effectively prune the search. Especially useful are optimizations that occur during the first steps of the algorithm, i.e., at the top of the search tree.

For C++ users, this will be enough pruning to make the program run in time under
worst case conditions. However, for Java and Python users, this is still too
slow (Java takes around 
$1.2$
 seconds for the worst case). Thus, we will need to
further optimize our search.

Optimization 4

If the path creates a dead end that is not the bottom left corner, either the
path will fail to visit all squares (the path may stop at the dead end or pass
over it, sealing a square off) or the path will end in the wrong location. Thus,
we want to avoid creating dead ends. For example, if the square to the left of
our current location is blocked on three sides (including our current location),
then the next step must be to the left in order to avoid creating a dead end.
After this optimization, the program runs in under $1$ second.
